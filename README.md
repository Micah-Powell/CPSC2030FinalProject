This is a basic movie theater management system written in Python. It allows users to interact with a virtual theater through a simple command-line menu. Users can view available movies, see which seats are open, purchase and cancel tickets, and order snacks like popcorn and hotdogs.
The system uses object-oriented programming with classes such as Customer, Employee, Movie, Room, Seat, and Ticket to keep everything organized. Each room has 30 seats, and movies are assigned to specific rooms. The Kiosk class runs the main menu and handles user interactions.
Customers can be created with a name and email, and their actions are tracked, including snacks they buy and tickets they hold. When a ticket is bought, the system checks for payment and seat availability. If a ticket is canceled, the seat becomes available again.
Some movies are preloaded, and everything runs in one script. To start the system, just download the file and run it in any python interpreter, (I use VScode), and follow the on-screen instructions.
